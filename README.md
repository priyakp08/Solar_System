SOLAR SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION IN BLENDER

Introduction
The illustration of the Solar System in Blender implementation will be presented and discussed in the given project report. The general idea is to develop a model that can take the approximate positions, masses and velocities of some planets and illustrate a realistic picture of the Solar System.
As these planet’s movements/motions are very hard to be captured from a real-time camera, computer graphic techniques can be utilized and equipped as another solution to generate the same expected frame of a planet’s movement. Blender is a program designed for any type of movie graphics. It has many lighting and angle capabilities, as well as a three-dimensional coordinate system.
This report outlines the methods used to visualize the artificial Solar System and presents a short animation (10 sec.) of created Solar System as a final achievement of the project.

Objects
The Solar System is the planetary system with the sun and planets. There are eight planets in total that orbit the Sun. For the given model implementation three planets have been taken as well as the Moon and the Sun.
